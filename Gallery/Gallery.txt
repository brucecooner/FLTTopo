Presented in this gallery are a few example contour maps generated with the flttopocontour application. 
I've overlaid the command used to generate the example maps on the images (this text does not appear in generated maps).

They were made with height data from an area southwest of Phoenix, Arizona, centered approximately on the Sierra Estrella Mountains.

The SESource file is a screenshot taken at https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/, with a bounding box over the area specified
in the commands via the 'rectnwse' option, from which the maps were generated.

The MinRegionPointsExample image shows a side by side comparison of part of a map, on the left generated without the minRegionPoints parameter, and on the right with minRegionPoints set to 100. 

Not all map modes have an example.
Note that images have been changed from bmp to jpg format.
